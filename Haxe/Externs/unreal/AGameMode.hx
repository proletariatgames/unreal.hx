  The GameMode defines the game being played. It governs the game rules, scoring, what actors
  are allowed to exist in this game type, and who may enter the game.
  
  It is only instanced on the server and will never exist on the client.
  
  A GameMode actor is instantiated when the level is initialized for gameplay in
  C++ UGameEngine::LoadMap().
  
  The class of this GameMode actor is determined by (in order) either the URL ?game=xxx,
  the GameMode Override value set in the World Settings, or the DefaultGameMode entry set
  in the game's Project Settings.
