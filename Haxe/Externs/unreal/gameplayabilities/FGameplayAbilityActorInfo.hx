/**
  FGameplayAbilityActorInfo
  
  Cached data associated with an Actor using an Ability.
          -Initialized from an AActor* in InitFromActor
          -Abilities use this to know what to actor upon. E.g., instead of being coupled to a specific actor class.
          -These are generally passed around as pointers to support polymorphism.
          -Projects can override UAbilitySystemGlobals::AllocAbilityActorInfo to override the default struct type that is created.
