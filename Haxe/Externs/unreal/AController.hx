/**
  Controllers are non-physical actors that can possess a Pawn to control
  its actions.  PlayerControllers are used by human players to control pawns, while
  AIControllers implement the artificial intelligence for the pawns they control.
  Controllers take control of a pawn using their Possess() method, and relinquish
  control of the pawn by calling UnPossess().
  
  Controllers receive notifications for many of the events occurring for the Pawn they
  are controlling.  This gives the controller the opportunity to implement the behavior
  in response to this event, intercepting the event and superseding the Pawn's default
  behavior.
  
  ControlRotation (accessed via GetControlRotation()), determines the viewing/aiming
  direction of the controlled Pawn and is affected by input such as from a mouse or gamepad.
