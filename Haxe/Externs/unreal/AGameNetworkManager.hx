    Accepted drift in clocks between client and server as a percent per second allowed.
    
    0.0 is "no forgiveness" and all logic would run on raw values, no tampering on the server side.
    0.02 would be a 2% per second difference "forgiven" - if the time discrepancy in a given second was less than 2%,
    the error handling/detection code effectively ignores it.
    
    Increasing this value above 0% lessens the chance of false positives on time discrepancy (burst packet loss, performance
    hitches), but also means anyone tampering with their client time below that percent will not be detected and no resolution
    action will be taken, and anyone above that threshold will still gain the advantage of this % of time boost (if running at
    10% speed-up and this value is 0.05 or 5% allowance, they would only be resolved down to a 5% speed boost).
    
    Time discrepancy detection code DOES keep track of LifetimeRawTimeDiscrepancy, which is unaffected by this drift allowance,
    so cheating below DriftAllowance percent could be tracked and acted on outside of an individual game. For example, if DriftAllowance
    was 0.05 (meaning we're not going to actively prevent any cheating below 5% boosts to ensure less false positives for normal players),
    we could still post-process analytics of the game showing that Player X regularly runs at 4% speed boost and take action.
