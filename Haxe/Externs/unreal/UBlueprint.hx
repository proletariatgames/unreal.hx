    Without setting this flag a blueprint will be marked dirty when it is duplicated and if saved while in this dirty
    state you will not be able to open the blueprint. More specifically, UClass::Rename (called by DestroyGeneratedClass)
    sets a dirty flag on the package. Once saved the package will fail to open because some unnamed objects are present in
    the pacakge.
    
    This flag can be used to avoid the package being marked as dirty in the first place. Ideally PostDuplicateObject
    would not rename classes that are still in use by the original object.
