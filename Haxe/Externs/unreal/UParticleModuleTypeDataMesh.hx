            XAxisFacing_NoUp                                - X-axis camera facing, no attempt to face an axis up or down.
            XAxisFacing_ZUp                                 - X-axis camera facing, Z-axis of the mesh should attempt to point up.
            XAxisFacing_NegativeZUp                 - X-axis camera facing, Z-axis of the mesh should attempt to point down.
            XAxisFacing_YUp                                 - X-axis camera facing, Y-axis of the mesh should attempt to point up.
            XAxisFacing_NegativeYUp                 - X-axis camera facing, Y-axis of the mesh should attempt to point down.
    All axis-locked camera facing options assume the AxisLockOption is set. EPAL_NONE will be treated as EPAL_X.
            LockedAxis_ZAxisFacing                  - X-axis locked on AxisLockOption axis, rotate Z-axis of the mesh to face towards camera.
            LockedAxis_NegativeZAxisFacing  - X-axis locked on AxisLockOption axis, rotate Z-axis of the mesh to face away from camera.
            LockedAxis_YAxisFacing                  - X-axis locked on AxisLockOption axis, rotate Y-axis of the mesh to face towards camera.
            LockedAxis_NegativeYAxisFacing  - X-axis locked on AxisLockOption axis, rotate Y-axis of the mesh to face away from camera.
    All velocity-aligned options do NOT require the ScreenAlignment be set to PSA_Velocity.
    Doing so will result in additional work being performed... (it will orient the mesh twice).
            VelocityAligned_ZAxisFacing         - X-axis aligned to the velocity, rotate the Z-axis of the mesh to face towards camera.
            VelocityAligned_NegativeZAxisFacing - X-axis aligned to the velocity, rotate the Z-axis of the mesh to face away from camera.
