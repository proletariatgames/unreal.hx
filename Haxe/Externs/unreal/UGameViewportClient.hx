  A game viewport (FViewport) is a high-level abstract interface for the
  platform specific rendering, audio, and input subsystems.
  GameViewportClient is the engine's interface to a game viewport.
  Exactly one GameViewportClient is created for each instance of the game.  The
  only case (so far) where you might have a single instance of Engine, but
  multiple instances of the game (and thus multiple GameViewportClients) is when
  you have more than one PIE window running.
  
  Responsibilities:
  propagating input events to the global interactions list
