  This is a component to allow interaction with the Widget Component.  This class allows you to
  simulate a sort of laser pointer device, when it hovers over widgets it will send the basic signals
  to show as if the mouse were moving on top of it.  You'll then tell the component to simulate key presses,
  like Left Mouse, down and up, to simulate a mouse click.
