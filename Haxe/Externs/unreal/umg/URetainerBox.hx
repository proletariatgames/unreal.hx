  The Retainer Box renders children widgets to a render target first before
  later rendering that render target to the screen.  This allows both frequency
  and phase to be controlled so that the UI can actually render less often than the
  frequency of the main game render.  It also has the side benefit of allow materials
  to be applied to the render target after drawing the widgets to apply a simple post process.
