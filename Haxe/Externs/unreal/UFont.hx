  A font object, for use by Slate, UMG, and Canvas.
  
  A font can either be:
    ● Runtime cached - The font contains a series of TTF files that combine to form a composite font. The glyphs are cached on demand when required at runtime.
    ● Offline cached - The font contains a series of textures containing pre-baked cached glyphs and their associated texture coordinates.
