  This struct holds the result of TextureStreaming Build for each component texture, as referred by its used materials.
  It is possible that the entry referred by this data is not actually relevant in a given quality / target.
  It is also possible that some texture are not referred, and will then fall on fallbacks computation.
  Because each component holds its precomputed data for each texture, this struct is designed to be as compact as possible.
