  Characters are Pawns that have a mesh, collision, and built-in movement logic.
  They are responsible for all physical interaction between the player or AI and the world, and also implement basic networking and input models.
  They are designed for a vertically-oriented player representation that can walk, jump, fly, and swim through the world using CharacterMovementComponent.
