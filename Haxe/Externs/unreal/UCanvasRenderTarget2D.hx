  CanvasRenderTarget2D is 2D render target which exposes a Canvas interface to allow you to draw elements onto
  it directly.  Use FindCanvasRenderTarget2D() to find or create a render target texture by unique name, then
  bind a function to the OnCanvasRenderTargetUpdate delegate which will be called when the render target is
  updated.  If you need to repaint your canvas every single frame, simply call UpdateResource() on it from a Tick
  function.  Also, remember to hold onto your new canvas render target with a reference so that it doesn't get
  garbage collected.
