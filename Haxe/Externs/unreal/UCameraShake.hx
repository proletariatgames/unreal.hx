/**
  A CameraShake is an asset that defines how to shake the camera in
  a particular way. CameraShakes can be authored as either oscillating shakes,
  animated shakes, or both.
  
  An oscillating shake will sinusoidally vibrate various camera parameters over time. Each location
  and rotation axis can be oscillated independently with different parameters to create complex and
  random-feeling shakes. These are easier to author and tweak, but can still feel mechanical and are
  limited to vibration-style shakes, such as earthquakes.
  
  Animated shakes play keyframed camera animations.  These can take more effort to author, but enable
  more natural-feeling results and things like directional shakes.  For instance, you can have an explosion
  to the camera's right push it primarily to the left.
