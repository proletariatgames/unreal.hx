  WARNING: This type was defined as MinimalAPI on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  A DamageType is intended to define and describe a particular form of damage and to provide an avenue
  for customizing responses to damage from various sources.
  
  For example, a game could make a DamageType_Fire set it up to ignite the damaged actor.
  
  DamageTypes are never instanced and should be treated as immutable data holders with static code
  functionality.  They should never be stateful.
