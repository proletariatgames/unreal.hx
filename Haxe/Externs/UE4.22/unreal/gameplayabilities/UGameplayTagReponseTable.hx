/**
  A data driven table for applying gameplay effects based on tag count. This allows designers to map a
  "tag count" -> "response Gameplay Effect" relationship.
  
  For example, "for every count of "Status.Haste" I get 1 level of GE_Response_Haste. This class facilitates
  building this table and automatically registering and responding to tag events on the ability system component.
