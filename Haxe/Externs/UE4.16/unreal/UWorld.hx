/**
  The World is the top level object representing a map or a sandbox in which Actors and Components will exist and be rendered.
  
  A World can be a single Persistent Level with an optional list of streaming levels that are loaded and unloaded via volumes and blueprint functions
  or it can be a collection of levels organized with a World Composition.
  
  In a standalone game, generally only a single World exists except during seamless area transitions when both a destination and current world exists.
  In the editor many Worlds exist: The level being edited, each PIE instance, each editor tool which has an interactive rendered viewport, and many more.
