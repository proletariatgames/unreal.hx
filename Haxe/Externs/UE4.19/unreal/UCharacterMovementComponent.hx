  CharacterMovementComponent handles movement logic for the associated Character owner.
  It supports various movement modes including: walking, falling, swimming, flying, custom.
  
  Movement is affected primarily by current Velocity and Acceleration. Acceleration is updated each frame
  based on the input vector accumulated thus far (see UPawnMovementComponent::GetPendingInputVector()).
  
  Networking is fully implemented, with server-client correction and prediction included.
